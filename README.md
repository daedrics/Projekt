# CRM - customer releatioship management

My first attempt of a proffessional application for a call center.
I had found this awesome tool (git) and I told my friend let's work with it. And we failed miserably. The message commits do not make any sense.
The merge conflicts were resolved by copying the projects to other folders and then trying somehow to undestand how to merge the changes from both of us. 
We were young and stupid but somehow we finished the project even though at the end we could not "deploy" it to a real server. It was my first project were I started to interact 
with real users and real neccessities.
